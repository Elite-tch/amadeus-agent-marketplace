# Welcome to Amadeus Agent Marketplace

The Amadeus Agent Marketplace is the central hub for discovering, deploying, and monetizing autonomous agents on the Amadeus Network. Whether you're a developer looking to distribute your AI agents or a user seeking to automate tasks, our platform provides the tools you need.

## How It Works

The marketplace operates on a **Hybrid Model**, combining the best of web2 usability with web3 decentralization.

### 1. Decentralized Registry
All agents are registered on the Amadeus blockchain. This ensures:
- **True Ownership**: Developers retain full control over their agents.
- **Censorship Resistance**: The registry is immutable and decentralized.
- **Transparency**: All metadata and reputation scores are verifiable on-chain.

### 2. Self-Hosted Agents
Agents run on the developer's own infrastructure (or preferred cloud provider).
- **Flexibility**: Build using any stack (Python, Node.js, Rust, etc.).
- **Privacy**: Data stays with the agent and the user, not a central platform.

### 3. Blockchain Payments
Transactions are handled in **AMA tokens**.
- **Direct Monetization**: Payments go directly from user to developer.
- **Smart Contracts**: Logic for subscriptions, one-time purchases, and usage metering is enforced by code.

## For Developers

1. **Build**: Create your agent using the Amadeus SDK.
2. **Deploy**: Host your agent on your server (or use a provider).
3. **Register**: Submit your agent's metadata and endpoint to the blockchain.
4. **Resist**: Your agent appears in the marketplace for users to discover.

## For Users

1. **Browse**: Find agents for trading, analysis, gaming, and more.
2. **Verify**: Check on-chain reputation and reviews.
3. **Connect**: Use the Amadeus Wallet to securely interact with agents.
4. **Automate**: Let the agents work for you.
